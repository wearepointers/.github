# About us

An agency that breathes the digital. Our passion for all things digital drives us to create solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.

We are innovative, creative, flexible, fast, and ambitious. We are Expanse.

## We love Open Source

Open Source code powers the internet. We try to give back to the community by fixing, improving, and sponsoring open source projects. We are always looking to improve the developer experience by creating tools and libraries that make our lives easier. We publish those tools and libraries as open source projects on our [Github](https://github.com/wearepointers) page.

## We love these technologies

### Frontend

We mostly use these frameworks and libraries for our frontend projects. However we always try out new technologies and are not afraid to use something new.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) 
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

Based on these technologies, we build the perfect stack for your project. We work using the Atomic Design principles and we strive to create reusable, fast, and maintainable components in every project. There is no one size fits all solution, every project is different and we adapt our stack to your needs.

### Backend

We build both REST and GraphQL APIs. To build robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs we use the following technologies.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [GoLang](https://golang.org/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

We use the following SQL and noSQL databases & technologies for fast and reliable data storage.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)

When building a backend, the number one priority is speed. In the modern age, 500ms+ response times are unacceptable. We strive to build APIs that respond in less than 100ms.

### DevOps

To make sure our applications are always available and fast we use the following technologies.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

We use Docker to containerize our applications and Kubernetes to orchestrate them. We deploy our applications to AWS, Google Cloud, or Digital Ocean. We use Github Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
